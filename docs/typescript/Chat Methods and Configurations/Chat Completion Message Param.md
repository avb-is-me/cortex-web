High Level

`ChatCompletionMessageParam` is a union type exported from the `cortex.chat` module of the Cortex Node.js SDK. It represents the different types of messages that can be sent or received during a chat conversation. This type is essential for building and managing conversational interactions with language models or chatbots.

```typescript
import Cortex from "@janhq/cortexso-node";
const cortex = new Cortex({
    baseURL: "http://localhost:1337/v1",
    apiKey: "",
});
```

## Why should I use this type?

The `ChatCompletionMessageParam` type is crucial for structuring and handling chat messages in a consistent and type-safe manner. By using this type, you can ensure that your chat messages conform to a specific format, making it easier to process and analyze them within your application. It also provides type safety, which can help catch potential errors during development and prevent runtime issues.

## What are the possible values?

The `ChatCompletionMessageParam` is a union type that can take one of the following values:

- `ChatCompletionSystemMessageParam`: Represents a system message, typically used to provide instructions or context to the language model.
- `ChatCompletionUserMessageParam`: Represents a message sent by a user.
- `ChatCompletionAssistantMessageParam`: Represents a message generated by the language model or chatbot.
- `ChatCompletionToolMessageParam`: Represents a message related to a specific tool or functionality.
- `ChatCompletionFunctionMessageParam`: Represents a message associated with a specific function or operation.

## Prerequisites

To use the `ChatCompletionMessageParam` type, you need to have the Cortex Node.js SDK installed and properly configured. Additionally, you should have a basic understanding of TypeScript and its type system.

## How do I use this type?

You can use the `ChatCompletionMessageParam` type whenever you need to define or work with chat messages in your application. Here's an example of how you might create a chat message object:

```typescript
import { ChatCompletionUserMessageParam } from "@janhq/cortexso-node";

const userMessage: ChatCompletionUserMessageParam = {
  type: "user",
  content: "Hello, how can I assist you today?",
};
```

In this example, we import the `ChatCompletionUserMessageParam` type and create an object that represents a user message. You can then pass this object to the appropriate functions or methods within the Cortex SDK to handle the chat conversation.

By using the `ChatCompletionMessageParam` type, you ensure that your chat messages are properly structured and typed, making it easier to manage and process them within your application.
