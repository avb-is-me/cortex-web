:::
## RAM (CPU Mode)

- 8GB for running up to 3B models.
- 16GB for running up to 7B models.
- 32GB for running up to 13B models.

## VRAM (GPU Mode)

- 6GB can load the 3B model (int4) with `ngl` at 120 ~ full speed on CPU/ GPU.
- 8GB can load the 7B model (int4) with `ngl` at 120 ~ full speed on CPU/ GPU.
- 12GB can load the 13B model (int4) with `ngl` at 120 ~ full speed on CPU/ GPU.

## Disk Space

- 10GB: The app is 1.02 MB, but models are usually 4GB+
