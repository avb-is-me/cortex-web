:::warning
ðŸš§ Cortex is under construction.

Embeddings are lists of floating-point numbers representing complex data in lower-dimensional or high-dimensional data. We can determine the similarity between different data points by measuring the [distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosine_similarity) between embeddings.
:::note
The Cortex Embeddings feature is fully compatible with OpenAI-compatible endpoints.

## Usage

<Tabs>
  <TabItem  value="CLI" label="CLI" default>
  :::note
  Ensure you have loaded the model into the Cortex server before calling the embeddings command.
  :::

    ```bash 
    # Without Flag
    cortex embeddings "Hello World"
    # With Model_id Flag
    cortex embeddings MODEL_ID "Hello World"
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="CURL" label="CURL">
  #### **Request**
  To get an embedding result from a model, use the following in your request:
  ```curl
curl http://localhost:1337/v1/embeddings \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d '{
        "input": "Hello",
        "model":"Llama-2-7B-Chat-GGUF",
        "encoding_format": "float"
    }'


  ```
  #### **Endpoint Response**
  Below are examples of the embedding endpoint response from the Cortex server:
  ```curl
{
    "embedding": [
      -0.9874749,
      0.2965493,
      ...
      -0.253227
    ],
    "index": 0,
    "object": "embedding"
}
  ```
