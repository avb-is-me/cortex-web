Embeddings are lists of floating-point numbers representing complex data in a lowerâ€”dimensional space, such as words, sentences, images, or other high-dimensional data. We can determine the similarity between different data points by measuring the [distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosine_similarity) between embeddings.
:::note
The Cortex Embeddings feature is fully compatible with OpenAI-compatible endpoints.

  ### Request
  To get an embedding result from a model, use the following in your request:
  ```curl
curl http://localhost:1337/v1/embeddings \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d '{
        "input": "Hello",
        "model":"Llama-2-7B-Chat-GGUF",
        "encoding_format": "float"
    }'


  ```
  ### Endpoint Response
  Below are examples of the embedding endpoint response from the Cortex server:
  ```curl
{
    "embedding": [
      -0.9874749,
      0.2965493,
      ...
