**High Level**

The `BatchesPage` is a class exported from the `cortex` Node.js SDK, specifically from the `cortex.chat` module. It extends the `CursorPage` class and is used to manage and interact with batches of data related to chat conversations or other chat-related operations.

The `cortex` object is initialized as follows:

```javascript
import Cortex from "@janhq/cortexso-node";
const cortex = new Cortex({
  baseURL: "http://localhost:1337/v1",
  apiKey: "",
});
```

**Why should I use this class?**

The `BatchesPage` class provides a convenient way to handle and work with batches of data in the context of chat operations. It inherits functionality from the `CursorPage` class, which likely includes methods for pagination, filtering, and efficiently retrieving data in batches. This can be useful when dealing with large datasets or long-running operations that need to be processed in smaller chunks.

**Methods Overview and Code Examples**

Since the provided code snippet only shows the class declaration, it's difficult to provide specific method examples. However, as an extension of `CursorPage<Batch>`, the `BatchesPage` class likely inherits methods for retrieving and manipulating batches of `Batch` objects. Some common methods you might expect to find include:

- `next()`: Fetch the next batch of data.
- `previous()`: Fetch the previous batch of data.
- `filter()`: Apply filters to the batch data.
- `map()`: Transform the batch data.
- `forEach()`: Iterate over the batch data.

Here's an example of how you might use the `BatchesPage` class:

```javascript
const batches = await cortex.chat.batches.list();

// Iterate over the first batch of data
batches.data.forEach((batch) => {
  console.log(batch);
});

// Fetch the next batch of data
const nextBatch = await batches.next();
```

**What are the required parameters or arguments?**

The provided code snippet doesn't include any parameters or arguments for the `BatchesPage` class. However, when instantiating or using methods from this class, you may need to provide parameters such as filters, pagination options, or other configuration options specific to the `cortex` SDK.

**Prerequisites**

Before using the `BatchesPage` class, you need to have the `cortex` Node.js SDK installed and properly configured with your API key and base URL. Additionally, you may need to import or require the necessary modules or classes related to chat operations and batch processing.

**How do I use this class?**

To use the `BatchesPage` class, follow these steps:

1. Import the `Cortex` class from the `@janhq/cortexso-node` package.
2. Initialize a new `Cortex` instance with your API key and base URL.
3. Access the `BatchesPage` class through `cortex.chat.batches`.
4. Use the methods provided by the `BatchesPage` class (and inherited from `CursorPage`) to retrieve, filter, and manipulate batches of data related to chat operations.

Example:

```javascript
import Cortex from "@janhq/cortexso-node";

const cortex = new Cortex({
  baseURL: "http://localhost:1337/v1",
  apiKey: "your_api_key_here",
});

// List all batches
const batches = await cortex.chat.batches.list();

// Filter batches based on specific criteria
const filteredBatches = await batches.filter((batch) => batch.status === "completed");

// Iterate over the filtered batches
filteredBatches.forEach((batch) => {
  console.log(batch.id, batch.status);
});
```

Remember to consult the official `cortex` SDK documentation for more detailed information and examples specific to the `BatchesPage` class and its methods.
