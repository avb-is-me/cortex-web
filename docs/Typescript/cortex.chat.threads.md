## High Level

The `ThreadsPage` class is a part of the `cortex` Node.js SDK, specifically within the `cortex.chat` module. It is a subclass of the `Page` class, which is likely a base class for handling paginated responses from the API. The `ThreadsPage` class deals with the management of chat threads.

The `cortex` object is initialized as follows:

```javascript
import Cortex from "@janhq/cortex-node";
const cortex = new Cortex({
  baseURL: "http://localhost:1337/v1",
  apiKey: "",
});
```

## Why should I use this class?

The `ThreadsPage` class provides a convenient way to interact with chat threads in your application. It encapsulates the logic for fetching, creating, updating, and deleting threads, as well as handling pagination when retrieving multiple threads.

## Methods Overview and Code Examples

Since the provided code is a class declaration without any methods, it is difficult to provide specific method examples. However, based on the naming convention and the fact that it extends the `Page` class, we can expect the following methods to be available:

- `list()`: Retrieves a list of threads, potentially paginated.
- `create(data)`: Creates a new thread with the provided data.
- `retrieve(id)`: Retrieves a specific thread by its ID.
- `update(id, data)`: Updates an existing thread with the provided data.
- `delete(id)`: Deletes a specific thread by its ID.

Example usage:

```javascript
// List threads
const threads = await cortex.chat.threads.list();

// Create a new thread
const newThread = await cortex.chat.threads.create({
  title: "New Thread",
  // ... other data
});

// Retrieve a specific thread
const thread = await cortex.chat.threads.retrieve(threadId);

// Update a thread
await cortex.chat.threads.update(threadId, { title: "Updated Title" });

// Delete a thread
await cortex.chat.threads.delete(threadId);
```

## What are the required parameters or arguments?

The specific parameters or arguments required for each method will depend on the implementation details of the `ThreadsPage` class and the underlying API. Common parameters may include:

- `list()`: Pagination parameters (e.g., `page`, `limit`), filtering options, etc.
- `create(data)`: An object containing the data for the new thread (e.g., `title`, `participants`, `messages`, etc.).
- `retrieve(id)`: The ID of the thread to retrieve.
- `update(id, data)`: The ID of the thread to update, and an object containing the updated data.
- `delete(id)`: The ID of the thread to delete.

## Prerequisites

To use the `ThreadsPage` class, you must have the `cortex` Node.js SDK installed and configured with a valid API key and base URL. Additionally, you may need to import or require the `cortex.chat.threads` module in your code.

## How do I use this class?

To use the `ThreadsPage` class, follow these steps:

1. Import or require the `cortex` SDK and the `cortex.chat.threads` module in your code.
2. Initialize the `cortex` object with your API key and base URL.
3. Access the `ThreadsPage` class through `cortex.chat.threads`.
4. Use the available methods (`list()`, `create()`, `retrieve()`, `update()`, `delete()`) to interact with chat threads, passing the required parameters or arguments.

Example:

```javascript
import Cortex from "@janhq/cortex-node";
import { ThreadsPage } from "@janhq/cortex-node/resources/chat/threads";

const cortex = new Cortex({
  baseURL: "http://localhost:1337/v1",
  apiKey: "your_api_key_here",
});

// List threads
const threads = await cortex.chat.threads.list();

// Create a new thread
const newThread = await cortex.chat.threads.create({
  title: "New Thread",
  participants: ["user1@example.com", "user2@example.com"],
});

// Retrieve a specific thread
const thread = await cortex.chat.threads.retrieve(threadId);

// Update a thread
await cortex.chat.threads.update(threadId, { title: "Updated Title" });

// Delete a thread
await cortex.chat.threads.delete(threadId);
```

Make sure to replace `"your_api_key_here"` with your actual API key, and handle any necessary error handling or additional configuration as per your application's requirements.
