**High Level**

The `RunStepsPage` class is part of the `cortex` Node.js SDK, specifically within the `cortex.beta.threads.runs` module. It is a subclass of the `CursorPage` class, which is likely a utility class used for handling paginated responses from the Cortex API.

The `cortex` object is initialized as follows:

```javascript
import Cortex from "@janhq/cortexso-node";
const cortex = new Cortex({
  baseURL: "http://localhost:1337/v1",
  apiKey: "",
});
```

**Why should I use this class?**

The `RunStepsPage` class is designed to handle paginated responses from the Cortex API when retrieving run steps for a specific thread run. It provides a convenient way to iterate over the run steps and potentially fetch additional pages of results if necessary.

**Methods Overview and Code Examples**

The `RunStepsPage` class inherits methods from the `CursorPage` class, which likely includes methods for fetching and iterating over paginated data. However, without the complete implementation details of the `CursorPage` class, it's difficult to provide specific method examples.

**Prerequisites**

To use the `RunStepsPage` class, you'll need to have the `cortex` library installed and imported into your Node.js project. Additionally, you'll need to have a valid API key and base URL for the Cortex API.

**How do I use this class?**

To use the `RunStepsPage` class, you'll typically retrieve an instance of it from another method or endpoint within the `cortex.beta.threads.runs` module. For example, there might be a method like `cortex.beta.threads.runs.listSteps(runId)` that returns an instance of `RunStepsPage`.

Once you have an instance of `RunStepsPage`, you can iterate over the run steps using standard JavaScript array or iterator methods, such as `forEach`, `map`, or a `for...of` loop.

Here's an example of how you might use the `RunStepsPage` class:

```javascript
const runId = "abc123";
const runStepsPage = await cortex.beta.threads.runs.listSteps(runId);

for await (const runStep of runStepsPage) {
  console.log(runStep);
}
```

In this example, `runStepsPage` is an instance of `RunStepsPage` returned from the hypothetical `cortex.beta.threads.runs.listSteps(runId)` method. The `for await...of` loop iterates over the run steps, and you can perform additional operations on each `runStep` object as needed.

Note that the actual implementation details and method names may differ based on the specific Cortex API and SDK documentation.
