## High-Level Overview

The `cortex.assistants` class is part of the Cortex Node.js SDK, specifically designed for managing AI assistants. It provides a convenient interface for creating, retrieving, updating, listing, and deleting assistants within the Cortex platform.

## Why Use the Assistants Class?

The `cortex.assistants` class simplifies the process of interacting with AI assistants in your applications. It abstracts away the complexities of making API requests and handles the necessary data transformations, allowing you to focus on building your application logic.

## Methods Overview and Code Examples

### `create(body: AssistantCreateParams, options?: Core.RequestOptions): Core.APIPromise<Assistant>`

Creates a new assistant with the provided model and instructions.

```typescript
const createParams = {
  model: 'gpt-3.5-turbo',
  instructions: 'Act as a helpful AI assistant.',
};

const assistant = await cortex.assistants.create(createParams);
console.log(assistant);
```

### `retrieve(assistantId: string, options?: Core.RequestOptions): Core.APIPromise<Assistant>`

Retrieves an existing assistant by its ID.

```typescript
const assistantId = 'assistant_123';
const assistant = await cortex.assistants.retrieve(assistantId);
console.log(assistant);
```

### `update(assistantId: string, body: AssistantUpdateParams, options?: Core.RequestOptions): Core.APIPromise<Assistant>`

Updates an existing assistant with the provided parameters.

```typescript
const assistantId = 'assistant_123';
const updateParams = {
  instructions: 'Act as a more helpful AI assistant.',
};

const updatedAssistant = await cortex.assistants.update(assistantId, updateParams);
console.log(updatedAssistant);
```

### `list(query?: AssistantListParams, options?: Core.RequestOptions): Core.PagePromise<AssistantsPage, Assistant>`

Retrieves a list of assistants based on the provided query parameters.

```typescript
const assistants = await cortex.assistants.list();
console.log(assistants);
```

### `del(assistantId: string, options?: Core.RequestOptions): Core.APIPromise<AssistantDeleted>`

Deletes an existing assistant by its ID.

```typescript
const assistantId = 'assistant_123';
const deletedAssistant = await cortex.assistants.del(assistantId);
console.log(deletedAssistant);
```

## Required Parameters and Prerequisites

Most methods in the `cortex.assistants` class require specific parameters, such as the assistant ID, creation parameters, or update parameters. Additionally, you'll need to have the Cortex SDK properly initialized with the appropriate API key and base URL.

## How to Use the Assistants Class

To use the `cortex.assistants` class, follow these steps:

1. Import the Cortex SDK and initialize it with your API key and base URL.
2. Access the `assistants` property to interact with the assistant management functionality.
3. Call the desired method (`create`, `retrieve`, `update`, `list`, or `del`) with the required parameters.
4. Handle the returned Promise or use async/await to work with the response data.

By leveraging the `cortex.assistants` class, you can streamline the process of managing AI assistants within your applications, enabling you to focus on building innovative solutions.
