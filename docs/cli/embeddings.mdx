```

### Options

```
Options:
  -m, --model <model_id>                   The models to generate the embeddings. By default, it will choose the active models, if any
  -i, --input <input>                      Input text to embed, encoded as a string or array of tokens. To embed multiple inputs in a single request, pass an array of strings or an array of token arrays
  -e, --encoding_format <encoding_format>  Encoding format for the embeddings. Supported formats are float and int. By default, the format will be float
  -d, --dimensions <dimensions>            The number of dimensions the resulting output embeddings should have. Only supported in some models
  -h, --help                               Display help for command
