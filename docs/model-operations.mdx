:::warning
ðŸš§ Cortex is under construction.
:::

Cortex's Chat API is compatible with OpenAIâ€™s [Models](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/models) endpoint. It is a drop-in replacement for model management.

In addition to the [Model API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/models), Cortex exposes lower level operations for managing models like downloading models from a model hub and model loading.

## Usage

<Tabs>
  <TabItem  value="CLI" label="CLI" default>
    ```bash 
    cortex models pull <repo_name-or-filepath>
    cortex models start
    cortex models stop
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="Javascript" label="Javascript">
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="CURL" label="CURL">
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Capabilities

### Model Hub

Cortex is compatible with 3rd party model hubs like [Hugging Face Hub](https://huggingface.co/models). 

To make the experience easier, Cortex has curated a list of models and their configurations.

### Model Settings

Cortex looks for a `model.yaml` to run models. Otherwise it is generated from model metadata. The yaml files are flat, portable and contains all the parameters needed to run models.

**Example `model.yaml`**
```yaml
# Cortex state
name: llama3
version: 1
files: [ ... ]

# Markup Language
prompt_template: ...
pre_prompt: ...
stop: ...

# Results Preferences
top_p: ...
temperature: ...
frequency_penalty: ...
presence_penalty: ...
max_tokens: ...
stream: true

# Engine Settings
ngl: ...
ctx_len: ...
n_parallel: ...
cpu_threads: ...
engine: cortex.llamacpp 
```

### Model Settings Templates

Cortex provides a small set of model settings templates for popular model architectures, like `ChatML`.

You can apply the templates to any model.
