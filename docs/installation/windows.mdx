## Prerequisites

### Dependencies

Before installation, ensure that you have installed the following:

- **Node.js**: version 18 and above is required to run the installation.
- **NPM**: Needed to manage packages.
- **Windows Subsystem Linux (Ubuntu)**: Required to install for WSL2 installation.

:::info
The **CPU instruction sets** are not required for the initial installation of Cortex. This dependency will be automatically installed during the Cortex initialization if they are not already on your system.
:::

### Hardware

Ensure that your system meets the following requirements to run Cortex:

## Cortex Installation

To install Cortex, follow the steps below:

### Step 1: Install Cortex

Run the following command to install Cortex globally on your machine:

:::info
Install NPM on your machine before proceeding with this step.
:::

```sh
# Install globally on your system
npm i -g @janhq/cortex
```
:::info
Cortex automatically detects your CPU and GPU, downloading the appropriate CPU instruction sets and required dependencies to optimize GPU performance.
:::

### Step 2: Verify the Installation

1. After installation, you can verify that Cortex is installed correctly by getting help information.

```sh
# Get the help information
cortex -h
```
2. Cortex is ready to use!

## Windows Subsystem Linux

To install Cortex using the NPM package in WSL2, follow the steps below:

### Step 1: Open your WSL2 Terminal

Open your Linux terminal in WSL2. For WSL2, you can use the Linux distribution terminal, which is Ubuntu.

### Step 2: Install Cortex

Run the following command to install Cortex globally on your machine:

:::info
Install NPM on your machine before proceeding with this step.
:::

```sh
# Install globally on your system
npm i -g @janhq/cortex
```
:::info

### Step 3: Verify the Installation

After installation, you can verify that Cortex is installed correctly by getting help information.

```sh
# Get the help information
cortex -h
```
## Build from Source

To install Cortex from the source, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the Cortex repository [here](https://github.com/janhq/cortex/tree/dev).
2. Navigate to the `cortex-js` folder.
3. Open the terminal and run the following command to build the Cortex project:

```sh
npx nest build
```

4. Make the `command.js` executable:

```sh
node "[path-to]\cortex\cortex-js\dist\src\command.js"
```

5. Link the package globally:

```sh
npm link
```
6. Initialize Cortex by following the steps [here](/docs/installation/windows).

## Uninstall Cortex

Run the following command to uninstall Cortex globally on your machine:
